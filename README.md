## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

The web app uses the reddit api to fetch data, like title, subreddit, body text, thumbnail, url, unix time posted, and flair. For some data, like body text and title, the information had to be picked apart to find relevant information, like price and tags. The imgur api was also used as some subreddits used imgur as the main way to display images. I made calls to this api to return the direct link to each image. Each subreddit had different formats, so I had to efficiently account for such things. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned so much from this project. I just decided to jump right into web development and I am so happy that I did. Prior to this project, I had never touched javascript and had limited knowledge of html and css. I am sure that the solutions to some of the problems I encountered could be solved much more elegantly but I am just happy to have been able to finish. Below is a list of skills and subskills that I picked up!
- JavaScript
  - How to define functions and general JS syntax
  - Calling APIs with JS
  - First time using JS
- React
  - How to make component cards
  - How to use the useEffect funciton
  - How to use useState function
  - First time using React
